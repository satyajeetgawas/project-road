# Project ROAD (Road Oddity Alerting Device)

Project ROAD aims to reduce the number of vehicle accidents by directly displaying the road signs inside the drivers cabin using a LCD display.

A RF transmitter is placed near a road sign that transmits the road sign message, for example a road sign displaying the speed limit.
The vehicle is fitted with a RF reciever that recieves the road sign message, decodes it and creates a visual notification using the LCD display.

The tx.c and rx.c contain the transmitter and reciever code respectively.
